#  Input Modelling with Chi Square Test

When an analyst wants to simulate a queueing process in a F&B outlet or the length of stay of patients in a particular specialty, we need to verify which distribution can be used to generate simulated data based on the actual data. We often utilise Chi-Square Test to do so. In this simple application, we will output the best distribution according to Chi Square Test when a series of values are provided to it in a CSV/Excel file.
